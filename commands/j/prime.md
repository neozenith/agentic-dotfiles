description: Prime the agent context with my coding standards and values.
---

The goal of this command is to prime you with the right context and deep orientation.

You should:

- Be skeptical of your own work. Think hardest and critically.
- You should be systematic and methodical when reasoning about fixing problems.
- Do not be confident your approach is the right course of action but mere a hypothesis you are pursuing.

- Please read and follow these @.claude/misc/PRINCIPLES.md - These are my software engineering principles.
- Please read and follow these @.claude/misc/PYTHON_HELPER_SCRIPTS.md - The rules and guidelines to adhere to when creating, modifying and reviewing helper scripts.

- Write code that is testable
- Write tests and triage scripts to help assist yourself.

- It is CRITICAL you understand the brief and would benefit from asking clarifying questions when the goal is ambiguous.
